* The *client software* is a node application that reads the registration key/hash from a file then 
retrieves login information from the server. The node app then customized a Docker file and builds a 
Docker container that opens an SSHD port with shell access.

tests to determine memory, drive space, processor speed, and internet speed. It then registers with the server
and uploads this benchmark data.

Rental fees are deposited into the renters account, minus administration fees.
