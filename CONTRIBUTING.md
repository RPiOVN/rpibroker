The best way to start is to read through the [specification documents](specifications/high-level-overview.md).
Next, introduce yourself on our [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/RPiOVN/Lobby).
Finally, review the Trello boards and look for a task you can take on. 
The Trello boards are split up into the primary areas of the P2P VPS system:

* [Marketplace](https://trello.com/b/U7aDKsSs/p2pvps-marketplace)
* [Server](https://trello.com/b/1TgG5PFE/p2pvps-server)
* [Client](https://trello.com/b/jqkUgHS5/p2pvps-client)
